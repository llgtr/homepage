My name is Kevin. I create things - some of them on a computer.

I love reading, lifting heavy weights, and learning new skills and concepts. Lately, I've been drawn to sailing and drawing as my favourite pastimes.
I strongly value stripping away complexity to get to the essence of things. I also appreciate humour, kindness, beauty, curiosity, discipline, improvement, independence, family and friends.

In the realm of computers, I'm interested in programming language theory, databases, reproducible infrastructure, performance, large datasets and emacs.
