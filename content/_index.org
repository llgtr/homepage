I'm Kevin and this is my little corner of the internet.

I love reading, lifting heavy weights and learning new things. Currently I'm learning to draw.
I strongly value stripping away complexity to get to the essence and I try to apply this to most facets of my life. I also appreciate humour, kindness, beauty, curiosity, discipline, improvement, independence, modesty, family and friends.

In the realm of computers, I'm interested in programming languages, databases, servers, performance, large datasets and emacs.
